## MetaMask

### Infura

Linea is available by default in MetaMask through an Infura RPC endpoint. 

<Tabs className="my-tabs">
    <TabItem value="extension" label="MetaMask Extension">

        **Linea Mainnet**

        Find the network selector in the top-left of MetaMask, and click to see your available 
        networks. From here, select Linea Mainnet:

        IMG

        If you don't see Linea Mainnet in the "Enabled networks" list, scroll to the "Additional
        networks" section, and click "Add". 

        **Linea Sepolia**

        In the networks menu, scroll until you see the "Show test networks" toggle. If it's off,
        switch it on; you should see Linea Sepolia in the list. Select it to get started.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mobile" label="MetaMask Mobile">
        **Linea Mainnet**

        Find the network selector at the top of the screen. Tap it to open the networks menu.

        Select "Linea Mainnet" to switch to it. If you don't see it in the list, scroll "Additional
        networks" list and tap "Add" to add Linea Mainnet to your wallet.
